    I am a doctoral candidate at the Stanford Graduate School of Education. My
    research focuses on ensuring equitable opportunities and access to learning
    for multilingual learners. Specifically, I use natural language processing
    and machine learning to analyze complex student dialogic participation in
    the classroom. I have developed LogoSearch, an online repository to collect,
    archive, and evaluate student conversations to support research and teacher
    professional development opportunities.

    Formally trained in educational measurement and assessment, I have extensive
    experience in the design, implementation, and evaluation of tests in the
    K-12 context. My involvement in quasi-experimental research supporting upper
    elementary students’ literacy has equipped me with the knowledge and skills
    for large-scale data collection and analysis. My background in educational
    technology allows me to examine and leverage alternative tools to assist
    student learning. Through long-term, research-practice partnerships, I have
    supported school districts in identifying and removing barriers that limit
    multilingual learners’ equitable access to mathematics courses.

    I am a mixed-methods researcher, using both qualitative approaches
    (interviews, think-aloud, collaborative/independent coding, and classroom
    observation) and quantitative techniques (surveys, statistical modeling,
    natural language processing, and deep learning) to generate research
    findings and present those findings with clear and creative graphical
    representations. I have worked with stakeholders in local education systems,
    including teachers, instructional coaches, school and district
    administrators, and philanthropic foundations.
